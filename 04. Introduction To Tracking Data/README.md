# Introduction To Tracking Data

## Steps to create a football pitch map:

* Here we will be discussing the step one can perform to make a plot of football pitch.

* We here are actually discussing the function *plot_pitch* present in *utility_functions_one.py*, i.e. the steps perfomed in the given funtion to plot the pitch map.

* In the function we are actually converting all the dimensions of pitch from yards to meters.(since field dimensions are typically defined in yards). We have used 105x68 meters^2 pitch area for our plot.
